abstract = {Trough trend analysis we can monitor our activities and that leads new approach of steering our research objectives. Recognition all trends is problematic. Ending trends as well starting trends are easily noted. Future trends are hard to find. We can guess possible actions at future but we can not know when or in which order. At this work approach is to look trends now and past. Statistically we can conclude which are the trends that are continuing or ending. That gives good glues about what are Trends at near future at sure. Megatrends tend to affect over dicispilinies. Academic research has it´s own trends and also those are reconized. Trends are from 2000 full texts at 12000 subjects written by 8834 writers. Most text are in field Production manufacturing and related manufacturing from metals.},
